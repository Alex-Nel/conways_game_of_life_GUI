## Conways game of life (with GUI)

This program will simulate Conways Game of Life. This is an update to my original game of life program.   

*This program relies on the SDL3 library, so it should be cross-platform.   
Be sure to include the SDL3 library and headers when compiling.

#### How to use it:

1. The main play area will be a huge grid of squares. Click on them to activate or deactivate them
2. Press the 3 buttons in the bottom to play the game.   
   Red Button: Steps through one generation   
   Green Button: The "play" button, which will automatically go through the next generations until you press it again   
   Blue Button: This clears the area, deactivating every square
